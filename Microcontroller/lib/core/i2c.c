 * @brief I2C Master Interface Library for ESP32
 * 
 * This library provides initialization and bus management for the I2C master 
 * interface on ESP32 devices, including semaphore-based access control for 
 * safe usage in multi-tasking environments.
 * 
 * The library handles the following:
 * - I2C master initialization with predefined configurations.
 * - Semaphore management for ensuring exclusive bus access.
 * - Functions to acquire and release the bus for multi-task applications.
 * 
 * @version 1.0
 * @date 2024-12-05

 * 
 * @note 
 * - This library is designed for ESP32 using the ESP-IDF framework.
 * - Ensure pull-up resistors are connected to the I2C lines as required for the 
 *   I2C protocol to work correctly.
